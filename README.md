## Create Your Own Profile Page

### Clone this Repo:
In the upper right of this page, there is a green button that says `Code`. Make sure the tab labeled SSH is selected, and then copy the file path below that.

Next, open your terminal and go to where you would like to place this repo. Once there, type in `git clone {file path here - don't include the brackets}` and hit enter, with file path being what you copied before.

This should have cloned this repo to your computer locally, so you can CD into the repo to check. If you run into issues, no worries! We can work on it together tomorrow.

### Run Page in Browser
In your terminal, cd into the project folder and run `open index.html`. This will open your page in the browser.

If you make changes to your html or css files, refresh the browser window to see those changes take effect.
